		 *  Instance bindings will always return the instance you configured, but you can reconfigure the instance binding in other contexts should you like.
		 *  
		 *  Singleton scope guarantees that guice will only provide a single instance of executed binding for the portions of the object graph under which the singleton is defined. In practice
		 *  if you define your singleton at the top level, it means all of the user created objects in the system.
		 *  
		 *  Context scope guarantees that Guice will only provide a single instance of the executed binding within the Context. However, unlike singletons, other contexts can redefine the 
		 *  binding. If a child context does not redefine a binding, guicejs will inquire with parent contexts.
